        <h3><b>PISTOL</b></h3>
        <p><i>Pistols can be wielded even at point-blank range.</i></p>
        <p style="line-height: 140%">
          Weapons with [PISTOL] in their profile are known as Pistols. If a unit
          contains any models equipped with Pistols, that unit is eligible to
          shoot in its controlling player’s Shooting phase even while it is
          within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. When such a unit
          is selected to shoot, it can only resolve attacks using its Pistols
          and can only target one of the enemy units it is within Engagement
          Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target an enemy unit
          even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same
          enemy unit.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 140%; margin-top: 30px">
          If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, unless it is a
          MONSTER or VEHICLE model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with
          all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will
          shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting
          targets.
